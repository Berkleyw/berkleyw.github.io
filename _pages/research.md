# Research

Research in our Lab reveals how photosynthetic fluxes interact with plant metabolism and the environment to drive energy capture, carbon fixation and growth. We use these findings to scale up the impact of photosynthetic metabolism to the leaf and canopy scale. Questions we find particularly interesting are those that produce a quantitative or integrative result. Our long-term vision is to combine classical measurements of carbon and energy exchange with recent advances in resolving metabolic fluxes through metabolism using isotopic labeling methods. Our ultimate goal is to engineer more efficient photosynthesis under dynamic conditions and better understand our planet’s response to climate change.

We have three main projects in the lab that are supported by various awards

**How does photorespiratory flux interact with other metabolisms?** 

Photorespiration is the second largest metabolic flux of carbon in an illuminated leaf and occurs when rubisco, the initial enzyme of carbon fixation, binds with oxygen instead of carbon dioxide and produces a molecule that must be recycled. Photorespiration recycles this molecule into Calvin-Benson cycle intermediates at the great cost of carbon dioxide and energy. Given its outsized role in central metabolism, we are interested in how photorespiration interacts with other aspects of central metabolism like nitrogen metabolism and one-carbon metabolism. To do this we use a variety of flux approaches, ranging from leaf-level measurements of photosynthesis to formal metabolic flux analysis using 13C labeled carbon dioxide.

<em>By using 13C as a label we are able to reconstruct metabolic fluxes and tie them into leaf-level gas exchange. In this flux map we determined that carbon dioxide release does not occur at large rates from the TCA cycle in the light, an important finding for understanding the carbon balance of plants.

**How does photorespiration beat the heat?** 

Understanding the mechanisms of carbon dioxide release during photorespiration is critical for predicting plant responses to climate change and potentially engineering plants with improved carbon assimilation and productivity. While there has been a lot of focus on the response of rubisco oxygenation to increased temperature, less is known about how downstream photorespiration responds, or if its response is always optimal to minimize excess carbon dioxide release. To investigate this, we are looking at how photorespiration adapts and acclimates to different conditions. We are also building a well-parameterized reaction-kinetic model of photorespiration to understand if it always behaves optimally and if there might be any room for improvement. The results of this project will reach across disciplinary boundaries with the strong potential to improve earth-system models of carbon cycling and to identify key traits for adapting photosynthesis to real-world growing conditions.

**What is the physiology of bioenergy crops?** 

Sustainable bioenergy systems require a shift from annual crops, like corn and soybean, to perennial crops that do not need to be replanted every year. These perennial crops avoid the annual soil disturbance that results in carbon dioxide release and a “carbon debt” that can take years to repay before the biofuel is net carbon negative. These perennial crops, like switchgrass, have unique physiology and high resilience to environmental stresses. In out lab we study the physiology of switchgrass to understand how it is able to maintain productivity under drought and other stresses to both further improve its productivity and learn lessons for potentially improving other crops.
