# Open positions
I am glad you are interested in checking out the lab. Here is what we currently can offer in terms of openings.

### Undergrads
Are you a student at MSU looking for research experience or to fulfill research credits? Are you checking out a summer research experience at MSU and are interested in the lab? I am always happy to talk. We prefer students in their first or second year so that you can learn the basics and be around for a few years, but have hosted juniors and seniors as well.

### PhD and Masters Students
We currently have funding for a single PhD position starting in the Fall of 2022. This would be for a student already admitted to any MSU program involving plants, so reach out if you are looking for rotations. If you want to talk about writing a proposal to bring in your own funding I am also happy to talk. I generally take students from the MSU [Molecular Plant Sciences Program](https://mps.natsci.msu.edu/) or [BioMolecular Science program](https://biomolecular.natsci.msu.edu/), but if you are applying to any graduate program at MSU and interested in fluxes and plants, let me know.

Note that we do not accept master's students.

### Postoc positions
We currently don't have any funded postdoc positions, so if you are interested in coming to the lab you will have to help get some funding. If you have time to put together an application I am always happy to help you develop ideas. If you are a US resident or citizen, sometime there are programs from the [National Science Foundation](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding) or the [Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/science/office-science-funding/office-science-funding-opportunities). You can also look out for Fellowships through the [Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center](https://www.glbrc.org/about/career-opportunities). If you based outside the US we can always try for a [Fulbright](https://cies.org/non-us-scholars/fulbright-visiting-scholar-program).If you happen to be a German resident you can also try the [Alexander von Humboldt Postdoc Fellowship](https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/en/apply/sponsorship-programmes/feodor-lynen-research-fellowship), I am a former alumni of the program and am happy to help you craft a compelling research plan.
